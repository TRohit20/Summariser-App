# Video Summariser-App
A Full stack Mobile App where users can enter or paste the videoID of any video from either Youtube or Vimeo and get the summary of the video! This is a utility app that saves a lot of time to users by summarising huge videos into short yet concise summaries.

## Tech Stack used
- Frontend- Swift and SwiftUI for Native iOS Application, Flutter for cross-platform.
- Backend- Python with Flask framework to setup the server and API endpoints

## Requirements
- You need to have Python installed on the system
- I suggest you to start and build the project in a virtual environment to make it easier to manage the dependencies.
- Install the necessary dependencies such as youtube-dlp, openai and whisper

## Installation 
- You can clone the project using the CLI command or directly using the Github Desktop
- To start the server and navigate to the terminal to backend folder and use this command:
```bash
python backend.py
```
- Once the server is up and running, you can build and run the User application from the frontend folder through IDE of your choice
  **NOTE:** The frontend of the application is not final and concrete, It is built for easy testing purposes. I will work on the Frontend and revamp the UI soon. In the meanwhile, Feel free to make modifications and make your own designs or contribute to frontend of the application :) 

## Wanna contribute?
- Feel free to fork the repository, set up the app locally and play around with it.
- Did you run into any issues while setting up or running the application ? Feel free to raise a issue [here](https://github.com/TRohit20/Video-Summariser-App/issues/new)
- Raise issues if you wanna add any new features or any edge cases I might have missed
- After the issue is assigned to you, you can work on it and raise a draft PR (Turn it to 'ready for review' after you are done working on it)
