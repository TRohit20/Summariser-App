# Video Summariser-App
A Full stack Mobile App built where users can just enter or paste the videoID/URL of any YT video and get the summary of the video! This is a utility app that saves a lot of time to users by summarising huge videos into short yet concise summaries.

## Tech Stack used
- Frontend- Swift and SwiftUI for Native iOS Application, Flutter for cross-platform.
- Backend- Python with Flask framework to setup the server and API endpoints

## Requirements
- You need to have Python installed on the system
- I suggest you to start and build the project in a virtual environment to make it easier to manage the dependencies.
- Install the necessary dependencies such as yt-dlp, openai and whisper

## Installation 
- You can clone the project using the CLI command or directly using the Github Desktop
- To start the server and navigate to the terminal to backend folder and use this command:
```bash
python backend.py
```
- Once the server is up and running, you can build and run the User application from the frontend folder through IDE of your choice
