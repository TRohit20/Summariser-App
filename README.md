# Video Summariser-App
A Full stack Mobile App for both iOS and Android where users can enter or paste the videoID of any video from either Youtube or Vimeo and get the summary of the video! This is a utility app that saves a lot of time to users by summarising huge videos into short yet concise summaries with key takeaways.

## Tech Stack used
- Frontend- Flutter for cross-platform support.
- Backend- Python with Flask framework.

## Requirements
- You need to have Python installed on the system
- I suggest you to start and build the project in a virtual environment to make it easier to manage the dependencies.
- Install the necessary dependencies such as youtube-dlp, openai and whisper
- You can install the required dependencices using the `requirements.txt` file in the backend folder.

## Installation 
- You can clone the project using the CLI command or directly using the Github Desktop
- To start the server, navigate the terminal to backend folder and use this command:
```bash
python app.py
```
- Once the server is up and running, you can build and run the User application from the frontend folder through IDE of your choice

**NOTE:** The frontend of the application is not final and concrete, It is built for easy testing purposes. I will work on the Frontend and revamp the UI soon. In the meanwhile, Feel free to make modifications and make your own designs or contribute to frontend of the application :) 

## Wanna contribute?
- Feel free to fork the repository, set up the app locally and play around with it.
- Did you run into any issues while setting up or running the application ? Feel free to raise a issue [here](https://github.com/TRohit20/Video-Summariser-App/issues/new)
- Raise issues if you wanna add any new features or any edge cases I might have missed
- After the issue is assigned to you, you can work on it and raise a draft PR (Turn it to 'ready for review' after you are done working on it)
